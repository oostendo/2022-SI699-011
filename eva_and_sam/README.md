We are working with the Commercial Building Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS) from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) to predict energy consumption and identify valuable areas for retrofitting.

## Moving To Net-Zero

Identifying Target Areas for Building Retrofitting

### The Problem:

Commercial and residential buildings responsible for 32% greenhouse gas emissions in U.S.
The worst performing buildings use 2.5-8 times more fossil fuel and electricity than the best performing
It is possible to achieve a 40% reduction in demand by 2030 and 80% reduction in building energy use intensity reduction by 2050
It would require retrofitting existing buildings with energy efficiency measures; commercial buildings undergoing major retrofits likely to achieve 50% reduction in energy demand
How can we help mobilize retrofitting efforts?

### Our Project:
We will help the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy (ACEEE) identify areas of the US to target for their efforts in advocating for retrofitting buildings with energy efficiency measures. 

Insights to ACEEE will enable the organization to maximize their impact, yielding more retrofittings per dollar spent on advocacy
What does success look like?
- Short-term: ACEEE incorporates areas we identify into their strategic planning
- Long-term: ACEEE works with 30% of buildings/building owners in targeted areas to activate retrofitting efforts
