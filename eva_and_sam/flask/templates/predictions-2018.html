    <h1>Predicted Total Energy Consumption</h1>
    <div>
        Although it is difficult to interpret multidimensional data in a 2-dimensional space,
        we've plotted our predictions against the first principal component. This helps give us
        an idea of how each of the model types are generating predictions. The green points were
        predicted by the baseline linear regression  model, and the blue points were predicted by
        the baseline SVM model. The predictions look consistent across both models, and this was
        also reflected when computing evaluation metrics.
