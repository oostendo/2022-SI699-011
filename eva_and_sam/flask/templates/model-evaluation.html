    <h1>Model Selection and Evaluation</h1>
    <div>
        Since we used multidimensional scaling to project our features into linear space,
        we chose simple ordinary least squares linear regression as our baseline.
        We also examined regularized regression models, and a baseline SVM with linear kernel.
        We preformed optimization using a cross-validation grid search to tune the model's
        hyperparameters. We compared all of our  models' performance, aiming to maximize how much
        variance our model could explain (R-squared) and minimize the average prediction error (MSE).
        Ultimately, we decided to make predictions using both the baseline SVM and Linear regression models.
